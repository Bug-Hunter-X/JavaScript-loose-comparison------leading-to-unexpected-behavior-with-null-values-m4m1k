# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (`==`) and its interaction with `null` values.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`).

**Problem:**

The original code uses loose comparison to check for `null` values. This can lead to unexpected results due to JavaScript's type coercion.  For instance, `0 == null` evaluates to `false`, which is not the same as checking whether the value is specifically `null`.

**Solution:**

The solution uses strict comparison (`===`) to accurately check if a value is specifically `null`. Strict comparison does not perform type coercion, preventing unintended behavior.

**How to run:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Execute the code to observe the different behaviors of loose and strict comparison.
